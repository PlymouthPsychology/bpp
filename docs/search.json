You need to choose someone who can write about your skills, experience, and achievements.\nYou should think about when you want to ask for your reference. You need to ask for your reference at least a month before you need it. You need to ask for your reference in a polite and professional way (either in person or via email).\nYou need to help the reference-writer do a good job for you!
