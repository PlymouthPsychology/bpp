However, recent research suggests that it is not just the quantity of practice that matters, but the quality of practice1\nThe idea of “Deliberate Practice” was described by Anders Ericsson to emphaise the importance of focused, structured practice in developing expertise (Ericsson et al., 1993).",

However, deliberate practice remains the primary predictor of expertise in many fields, and is typically the only factor which we have individual control over. Inherited general intelligence or working memory capacity may also predict expertise, but we can’t choose our parents! For a detailed discussion of the evidence, see Hambrick et al. (2020).↩︎",

Here are some specific points of feedback:\n\nPositives:\n\nClear Description: You clearly explained that the graph shows the strength of a conditioned response in relation to the number of conditioning trials.\nGood Use of Terminology: You correctly used terms like “conditioning trials” and “asymptote,” which are important for understanding the graph.\nLogical Flow: Your explanation followed a logical progression, from describing the initial steep increase to the eventual leveling off of the curve.\n\n\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n\nAvoiding Fillers: While your explanation was generally clear, there were a few instances where you used filler phrases like “So basically” and “But after a while.” These can be reduced to make your explanation even more precise.\nDetails on Asymptote: You mentioned the asymptote but could add a bit more detail on what it represents. For example, you could explain that the asymptote indicates the maximum strength of the conditioned response that can be achieved through conditioning, regardless of the number of additional trials.\n\n\n\nAdditional Points to Consider:\n\nInitial State: You might mention that the strength of the conditioned response starts at a very low level initially before increasing.\nReal-World Examples: Providing a real-world example of a conditioned response, such as Pavlov’s dogs salivating at the sound of a bell, could help to contextualize the graph for your audience.\n\nOverall, you did an excellent job! With a few minor adjustments, your explanation will be even more effective. Keep up the good work!"

    "text": "Hermann Ebbinghaus, 1850-1909\n\n\n\nOverview\nXXX TODO ADD A VIDEO EXPLAINER OF ALL THIS MATERIAL AT THE HEAD OF THE PAGE\nOver time we forget things, but in the 19th century, Ebbinghaus discovered that we forget things in a predictable way.\nHis work on the ‘forgetting curve’, since replicated (Murre and Dros 2015), showed that we forget things quickly at first, but then more slowly over time.\nReviewing and rehearsing what we have learnt at regular intervals helps us remember things for longer.\nThe forgetting curve diagram below shows this: Without reviewing what we learn, after 30 days we will have forgotten almost all of of it (the first line on the graph). But reviewing the material on day 2, 10, 30 and so on interrupts the forgetting process. The forgetting curve becomes less steep, and we remember more of what we have learnt for longer.\n\n\n\nTODO REPLACE/REDRAW IMAGE\n\n\n‘Spaced repetition’ is a technique that makes use of this property of memory. By reviewing things just before you are likely to forget them, research suggests that you can flatten the forgetting curve and retain information for much longer.\nBahrick et al. (1993) showed that spacing your learning over a longer time is much more effective than cramming. They found that when students spaced their revision over 8 weeks, rather than just 2, they could spend half as much time studying and still remember more of the material. Many other studies show the same effect.\n\n\nHow to use spaced repetition\nUse Anki!\nAnki is a free, open-source flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to help you remember things.\nYou can create your own flashcards, and Anki schedules a review of the cards at the best possible intervals. The algorithm saves you time, because you will only review material when it has the largest possible benefit to your memory.\n\n\nInstructions\n\nDownload Anki to your computer: https://apps.ankiweb.net\nAdd 10 flashcards to your “deck” based on information in lectures this week (see how below)\nReview the flashcards, and keep practicing over the next few weeks.\nMake a note on Psylab. Write a short paragraph describing how you found the process, and whether you think it will be useful for you in the future.\n\n\n\nUsing Anki\n\nInstalling Anki and adding cards\nOnce you have installed Anki from: https://apps.ankiweb.net, open the Application.\nIt should look like this:\n\n\n\nThe Anki interface\n\n\nClick “Add” to create your first cards.\n\n\n\nThe Anki interface\n\n\nEnter what you want to see on the “Front” and the “Back” of the flashcard. This is what you will see when you test yourself.\nFor example you might add something like this:\n\n\n\nAdding a card\n\n\nDeciding what to add to your cards is a bit of an art. We have some guidance below, but as some suggestions from lectures this week:\n\nXXX ADD a list of 3 facts from lectures we suggest here\n\n\n\n\nWriting good cards\nWriting effective Anki cards is a skill. Here are some tips and best practices for creating high-quality cards:\n\nKeep It Simple\n\nOne Fact Per Card: Each card should test only one piece of information. This makes it easier to focus on specific details and ensures that you thoroughly understand each concept. Clear and Concise: Use simple language and avoid unnecessary details. The goal is to make the question and answer as clear as possible.\n\nOnly Add Information You Understand\n\nAvoid Rote Memorization: Don’t add information to your cards if you don’t understand it. Focus on comprehension rather than memorization. A good tip is to add material as you cover it during the year (don’t try and add the textbook!)\n\nUse Images and Mnemonics\n\nVisual Aids: Where possible, include images, diagrams, or charts. Visual information can enhance memory retention and make studying more engaging. Mnemonics: Use mnemonic devices to help remember complex information. Associating facts with memorable phrases or images can improve recall.\n\nActive Recall\n\nFormulate Questions: Instead of simply noting down facts, turn them into questions. This engages your brain more actively and improves learning. Avoid Yes/No Questions: These don’t encourage deep thinking. Use open-ended questions that require a detailed answer.\n\nContextual Learning\n\nAdd Context: Where applicable, provide a brief context or example to explain why the information is relevant or how it is used. Link Concepts: Create cards that connect related ideas, showing how different pieces of information fit together.\n\nPersonalize Your Cards\n\nRelate to Your Experiences: Customize cards with examples that are meaningful to you. This personal touch can make the information more memorable. Use Your Own Words: Writing in your own words helps ensure that you understand the material and makes it easier to recall.\n\n\nExtension activities\nTry adding Anki cards for things outside of your lectures. For example, you could add:\n\nKey terms from your reading\nDefinitions of key concepts\n\nMake sure you review your cards regularly. You can also add and review cards on your phone:\n\nAnkiDroid for Android (free)\niPhone app (paid)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\nReferences\n\nBahrick, Harry P, Lorraine E Bahrick, Audrey S Bahrick, and Phyllis E Bahrick. 1993. “Maintenance of Foreign Language Vocabulary and the Spacing Effect.” Psychological Science 4 (5): 316–21.\n\n\nMurre, Jaap MJ, and Joeri Dros. 2015. “Replication and Analysis of Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve.” PloS One 10 (7): e0120644."

Preparation (re-read course notes), understanding not transcribing, active participation (ask and note questions, even if just in your head); conceptualise, summarise. Review and reduce notes later. Activity: Practice the Cornell note-taking method on a single lecture and submit it to Psylab.\nHow to use spaced practice/flashcards. (Not sure about actually requiring them to use anki)\nTime management: Run later in the year? Provide students with a list of topics they might encounter in exams and ask them to create a schedule for their revision (or mark off what they have already revised). Provide examples of effective revision materials and notes (i.e. show what good students actually do).\nHow to read a paper/where to look for specific bits of information\nSearching: How to use google scholar effectively. Forward and backward citations. Tasks 1: Make the longest chain of citations you can (prize for 10 citation stretching &gt; 100 years). Task 2: find a replication of a specific experimental paper through citing articles and in-text citations. Task 3: Find a list of experiments which were inspired by a classic experimental study, or papers which use a specific measurement technique or psychometric scale.\nLit searching in some form. Find something on social media… Think of a book? Or play them a YouTube video (of street magic?) What does psychology have to tell us about it? Spend 10 mins brainstormig and 10 mins using google scholar. Summarise what you found.\nCould also do same for debunking psy “facts”- you only use 5% of yourbrain - purple makes you relaxed. Ask Jan about this - followup critical thinking task?\nPeer review: Read a friend’s assessment before the deadline. Give structured feedback/use the marking rubric.\n\nOther thoughts: Revision techniques, Reading: Finding, reading and citing literature; Zotero; research/writing tools (ChatGPT); academic standards. GTD (getting things done): Personal organisation and time management. Task is to try GTD for 2 weeks."

Task 1 starts with a typical student essay style (so lots of easy verbiage to cut). Task 2 is more demanding: reduce a paper to an elevator pitch or single line. Give each student in the group a different audience when cutting words? Which words should we cut? Does our audience matter when cutting?\nWrite like Boris: Johnson wrote 2 articles in 2016, one pro one anti Brexit. Use this to introduce the idea of writing from opposing perspectives on the same question and practive exploring features of persuasive arguments. Maybe give them a set of facts/evidence which is ambiguous/balanced on some question and ask them to construct an argument in both directions?\n“hiya!!! 💕🎉😂”: (re)Introduce the concept of formal/informal written register. Cover writing a professional email and wow to ask a good question (give details, be specific, etc). Deal with informality and ‘journalistic’ phrasing in academic reports. When and how to use “I” or “we” etc. In scientific writing nobody cares about your opinion — they care about your argments. Task 1: write a letter applying for a job. Task 2: Write 2 summaries of a paper (building on “chop chop”) for 2 different audiences (i.e. deliberately repeat the same task in different contexts as practice).\nPersuasive writing practice: focus on answering the question (linked to thinking/argument).\nCite it right: Ask students to proof read and correct text with incorrect citations (or show them how ChatGPT can fix this for them)."

(Jackie)\nMatch an experimental design to the research question it can answer\nWhat did you come to uni to study psychology for? What prompted it? Do a lit search… do we know the answer yet? What sort of information have we gained about it?\nExperimental logic: Activity is to spot and correct errors of logic or reasoning in a text, given some background information on a study. Similar to Jackie’s existing activity about inference from graphs. Cover ideas like generalisation from a small sample. Concrete outcome is to complete a section of an essay: e.g. give students the text of an essay where this study is discussed, but with the sentences where the study is described and used to support the argument obscured. Students don’t need to read the original paper (they have the summary details) so the activity is scaffolded; the emphaisis on connecting the details of the study to the argument.\nExtraordinary claims: Activity should make students think about and argue in relation to a hierarchy of evidence. Perhaps create a debate where students have to use evidence provided to them which is of different types: anecdotal (personal/family recommendations), observational (e.g. cohort study), experimental (small clinical trial), and synthesised (e.g. systematic review). Or a short writing activity where students given limited space so have to summarise and prioritise each type of evidence when making their case? Perhaps they have to select 2 of 5 sources and justify their selection? Craft the examples so the students have to trade-off study sample size against experimental rigour.\nThe replication game: Students get some information on what makes studies more/less likely to fail to replicate (e.g. recorded flipped classroom session based on Andy’s materials). Then we give them 10 abstracts + details of the methods on real studies and the group activity is to read, discuss, decide which ones replicated and which ones didn’t. We run it like a quiz/competition in a seminar.\nSpot the logical fallacy: staff introduce a deliberate error of reasoning in their lecture that week and the task is to spot them. Examples would include argument from authority,\nArguments: Changes from A-level. Why PEE isn’t enough any more. Introduce Toulmin’s model?\nEvidence: Hierarchy of evidence; peer review. Distinguishing facts from opinions.\nExam planning (perhaps a choice of activities to complete in advance of of a progress meeting and review with their tutee). Perhaps more stage 2"
