It’s the thing you do that makes you good.”\n— Gladwell (2008)\nYou might have heard of the “10,000 hour rule”; it suggests that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in a field. However, recent research suggests that it is not just the quantity of practice that matters, but the quality of practice1\nThe idea of “Deliberate Practice” was described by Anders Ericsson to emphaise the importance of focused, structured practice in developing expertise (Ericsson et al., 1993).",

A meta-analysis (i.e. a review of all the quantitative studies available, Macnamara et al., 2014) suggested that the relationship between practice and expertise was not as strong has had been claimed. However, deliberate practice remains the primary predictor of expertise in many fields, and is typically the only factor which we have individual control over. Inherited general intelligence or working memory capacity may also predict expertise, but we can’t choose our parents! For a detailed discussion of the evidence, see Hambrick et al. (2020).↩︎",

You need to ask for your reference at least a month before you need it. You need to ask for your reference in a polite and professional way (either in person or via email).\nYou need to help the reference-writer do a good job for you!
