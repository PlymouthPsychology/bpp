### Setting up zoom ready for week 1 {#problem-zoom}

Problem in getting everyone ready for 10am zoom in week 1?

-   Can we use tutor meetings in Induction week to make sure everyone can get online?

-   Can we leave the meeting running and playing a funny video all week so they can test that the can get access?
