Weekly briefings happen **every Monday morning at 10am**, on Zoom. They are live events and not recorded.

All students are expected to attend the weekly briefing. 

You won't need to turn your camera on (but you can ask questions via chat).

<!--# note challenge of making sure everyone on zoom for first week? should week 1 briefing be in lecture theatre? -->
