### What you need to know

In Stage 1, we run a scheme called "Briefing, Practice and Progress". Each week we make regular times to:

1.  [Brief](briefings.html) you on what is coming up in lectures, workshops and assessments, and
2.  Introduce a [task to 'practice'](practice.html): these activities build the skills you need to succeed on the course.
3.  Provide an opportunity to review your work with your tutor.

In each semester you will have two [progress meetings](progress.html) with your tutor. These are to reflect on feedback, and make plans to structure your work in the coming weeks.
