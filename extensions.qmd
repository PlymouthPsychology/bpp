During the term, we know you are busy and we keep practice tasks as short as possible to ensure everyone is able to complete them every week. However, sometimes you will find that tasks are particularly relevant â€” either because they are on a topic of interest, or because it covers a skill you struggle with.

These tasks provide additional resources and opportunities for practice, to help you develop your skills. These are optional, but we encourage you to take advantage of them if you feel you need more practice on a particular topic. 

You can record this additional practice in the same way as the regular tasks, and your tutor will also be able to see your work and provide feedback.

\#TODO work out how to record these tasks
