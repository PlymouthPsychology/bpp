# STUDENT RESPONSE

This is what they said:

----

So this is a slide from one of Peter's lectures and the title is called Learning Curves, but it's really about the strength of a conditioned response as you do an increasing number of conditioning trials.

So basically the graph is a curve and it starts really rising steeply and then it levels off.

So to begin with you get a big change in the conditioned response for every extra trial you do.

But after a while it tails off and you get something called an asymptote.

So that means that after a while you won't get any increase in the conditioned response no matter how many trials you do.

# YOUR TASK NOW

Give feedback to the student on how well they did?
Was their speaking clear? Did they avoid lots of filler words?
Did the description explain the graph clearly? What else could they add?

Be positive and encouraging.

Write your feedback directly to the student (but not as a letter).
