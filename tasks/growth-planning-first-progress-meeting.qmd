# What are progress meetings for?

Students often find that the transition from school to university is difficult. 
This is rarely because the material you study is more complex; most of the time, 
it is because the _way_ you are expected to learn is different, and because
*you must take more responsibility for your own learning*.

Progress meetings are regular 'checkpoints' in the year where you can:

- review what you have done so far, and how successful it has been
- ask questions about the course, or about the way you are working, and
- work with your tutor to make plans for the weeks to come


The aim is to provide space to reflect on your progress, and give you the confidence to take
responsibility for your own learning.



# Format and scheduling

As a [reminder](../progress.html), progress meetings will

- include your tutor and one other student
- last around 45 minutes
- be held face to face in your tutor’s office

Part 2:

After the meeting, make notes on:

- what was discussed
- any actions that were agreed (and a deadline if there is one)

Remember, these notes are important because they will feed into your next progress meeting, and because they will help you to keep track of your progress throughout the year.
